            <p id="ABOUT">Greetings! I'm thrilled to share my creative project, which has consumed seven hours of my dedicated effort since it was assigned by my English teacher. Despite the time invested, I found great joy in its creation and will defintley further develop this exact project in the future. This is my first attempt, and I know there's room for improvement, but I hope that everyone will appreciate it. </p>
